    <p>
      I'm a Swiss Army knife of software development with professional experience
      in developing virtual reality games, full-stack development, and teaching.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have a strong background in machine learning which goes along with my
      data-driven approach to development to create the best product for the
      client and users.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I'm not programming, I like to lift weights, go on runs, and listen
      to 80's music! I'm a sports analytics nerd to make up for my horrible
      predictions.
